Question 1

In what way did you "clean up" or divide up the text into words
(in the program; the text files should be left unaffected)?
This does not have to be perfect in any sense, but it should
at least avoid counting "lord", "Lord" and "lord." as different words.

Answer 1:

We eliminate all the symbols, numbers and make all words lower case. So our definition of word is all the words, also words like "my" or "of".

Question 2

Which data structures have you used
(such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, ...)?
Why does that choice make sense?

Answer 2:

We used counter dictionaries from collection library for letters and words and nested disctionaries for successors.
We need dictionaries because we need to store key, in this case the name of the word, and their values.
